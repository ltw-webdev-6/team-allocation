# Team allocation

## Overview

Teams will be allocated into groups of 3 people. Each person on the team will be the lead of a specific segment of the project, with a project manager guiding the whole project.

_Even though certain people are leads for segments, every person must contribute to everything._

When you’ve found all your teammates, together come up with an awesome team name!

## Members

Determine, based on your group, which team member is strongest in each different lead position, and assign them a role:

### Project Manager

1. Makes sure everything is running on time
2. Determines what tasks need to be completed each week
3. Delegates the tasks to the team members

### UX Lead

1. Critiques & analyzes all UX deliverables
2. Makes the final decision for UX-related stuff
3. Helps define the deliverables and their success

### Dev Lead

1. Critiques & analyzes all code deliverables
2. Makes the final decision for all code-related stuff
3. Helps define the deliverables and their success

## Team name

As a group, come up with an awesome team name that you can use on GitHub. In the next lesson we’ll be setting up the GitHub repository and organization—so you’ll need a team name.

The organization can also be customized with a logo—so it might be fun to make a fast logo for your team too.

## Hand in

Email your teacher with a roster of your team members, their roles within the project, your team name, and the organization’s URL.

_Probably best to do this after completing the [GitHub project setup lesson](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-6/github-project-setup/)._
